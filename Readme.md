# Final Capstone - Virtual Stock Market Game

Virtual Stock Market game that allows users to buy and sell stocks and track their results. Each player receives a starting balance of $100,000 for investments when they start or join a game. The game gets live stock market data every 15 minutes and has 150 stocks so you can have fun seeing how your play investments would do in the real world. It also has 6 months of historical data (updated daily) to allow you to research stocks. Players can create games and play solo or invite existing players to play or join existing games.  When the game ends the system sells all owned stocks and the user with the highest ending balance wins.

We deployed it to Azure so check it out here (be sure to register to play!): http://virtualstockmarket.azurewebsites.net/

This was my final capstone project at Tech Elevator. It was run as a 2 week agile sprint with a product owner (Tech Elevator staff), scrum master (instructor), and a 4 student development team. We had daily standups and sprint reviews. It uses Vue for the front end and ASP.NET Core MVC for the backend. We used a Trello board to manage the project:
